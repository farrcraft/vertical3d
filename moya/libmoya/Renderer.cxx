    coordinate systems:
        "object"		coordinate system current primitive is defined in.
                        modeling transformation converts from object to world coordinates.
        "world"			standard reference coordinate system. camera transformation
                        converts from world to camera coordinates.
        "camera"		coordinate system with the vantage point at origin and direction
                        of view along positive z-axis. projection and screen transformation
                        convert from camera to screen coordinates
        "screen"		2-d normalized coordinate system corresponding to image plane.
                        raster transformation converts to raster coordinates.
        "raster"		raster or pixel coordinate system. are of 1 in coordinate system
                        corresponds to area of single pixel. coordinate system is inherited
                        from display or set by selecting resolution of desired image.
        "NDC"			normalized device coordinates. like "raster" but normalized so
                        x and y both run from 0 to 1 across whole (uncropped) image,
                        with (0,0) at upper left of image and (1,1) at lower right (regardless
                        of actual aspect ratio).

    default projection is orthographic.
    coordinates are mapped left-handed - +x points right, +y points up, +z points inward.
    
    - before any transformations, the current transformation matrix contains the identity matrix
    as the screen transformation.
    - usually the first transformation command is RiProjection, which appends the projection matrix
    onto the screen transformation, saves it, and reinitializes the current transformation matrix
    as the identity camera transformation.
    - after the camera coordinate system is established, future transformations move the world
    coordinate system relative to the camera coordinate system. 
    - when RiWorldBegin is called, the current transformation matrix is saved as the camera 
    transformation.
    - subsequent transformations inside RiWorldBegin-RiWorldEnd establish different object coordinate
    systems.

        point (px, py, pz) distance to plane equation:
            d = A *px + B*py + C*pz + D
