/**
 *
 * This version of pong began as a personal challenge to create the simple game.
 * Once a relatively complete and playable implementation was finished, much of
 * the common reusable code was extracted out into a separate library - libhookah.
 * Subsequent iterations of this source have been to support testing the evolving
 * design of that library. The core game logic has not otherwise significantly 
 * changed since then.
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 * ( ) support key rebinding
 * ( ) modify game vars
 * ( ) network multiplayer mode
 * ( ) p2p network mode
 * ( ) server network mode
 * ( ) save keybind / gamevar changes
