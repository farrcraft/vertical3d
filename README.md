# Vertical3D Ecosystem Mono Repo

The Vertical3D ecosystem is a set of libraries I wrote for supporting various 3D applications and 
games that I've toyed with writing over the years.

This a monorepo that contains all of the v3d libraries and the projects that use them. 


## History

A lot of this code can be traced back to the "early aught's" in a land before what we would call 
"modern C++". There was a single namespace, every library was its own repo/package and the build
system used autotools on unix & Visual Studio solutions/projects on Windows.

While that is a very modular design that has worked well for other OSS projects (e.g. KDE, Gnome)
that split functionality across a larger number of smaller packages, it's much more work to maintain.

In the current iteration, everything is being moved into a monorepo, both build systems have been  
entirely replaced with CMake, namespaces are more granular, and code is targetting C++17 or newer.
